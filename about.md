Hi! I'm **Naitian**.

I'm a sophomore at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (go blue!). Before
that, I was at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology. I enjoy
programming, playing sweet, sweet tunes on the tenor saxophone, and poking and
prodding at data. Lately, I've been working with Professor [David
Jurgens](http://jurgens.people.si.umich.edu/) at the
[Blablablab](https://blablablab.si.umich.edu).

You can also find me creating interactive visualizations for the [Michigan
Daily](https://michigandaily.com) and organizing data science projects for the
[Michigan Data Science Team](https://mdst.club)


I promise I am [who I am](https://keybase.io/naitian).
