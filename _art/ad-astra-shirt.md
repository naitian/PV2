 The 2016 TJHSST Marching Band show, entitled 'Ad Astra', told the story of
 human spaceflight.

 The marching band uses student-submitted designs for its two show shirts. The
 design shown was one of the two to be selected. 

 Some challenges and considerations that I ran across while designing the shirt
 included limited color range and comfort.

 The shirt was restricted to being black and white. This was an interesting
 challenge, and led to an exploration in using negative space. The image on the
 shirt depicts the dark side of the moon, with a spaceship breaking through into
 the light.

 A practical consideration was one of comfort. The marching band rehearses for
 long hours in the summer, and designing a shirt that was comfortable enough to
 wear during rehearsals and under a heavy woolen uniform meant I needed to show
 some restraint in the design. The ink tends to stick to the body and become
 uncomfortable when the temperature rises, which was another reason I chose to
 leave lots of whitespace in the design.
