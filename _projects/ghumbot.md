# Ghumbot? Ghum!? What are these things you speak of? :de::computer:

As you may have noticed, I'm quite the [avid](/projects/dictcc-js)
[German](/projects/deutschball) student, and at TJ, all sophomore German
students are eligible to take a **German-Humanities** course (GHum), which is
essentially English 10 and World History and Geography 2 with special emphasis
on Germanic culture. As all modern schoolchildren know, in this day and age, every
class has a Facebook Messenger group chat for discussing the school day (and
screwing around). With this in mind, I decided to build a **Messenger bot** for the
group to spice things up a little bit.

# Where can I try this?

I think it's down right now? The original implementation was super hacky, and I
still have to fix it. In the mean time, you can play around with [another bot
that I made](https://www.facebook.com/messages/100012150491617), for the Track
and Field Pole Vault squad. Send `!help` to get started.

# Cool! Where can I learn more?

You can read more at the [README](https://github.com/naitian/GHUMbot).
