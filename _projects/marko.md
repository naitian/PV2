# Marko

Here is a link to the [Github repo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naitian/Marko).

Marko uses `fbchat` and `markovify` to generate messages that sound like your
friends. To use Marko, simply run

```sh
python chatbot.py <id> <name>
```

where `id` is the Messenger ID of the person you're trying to emulate, and
`name` is an optional display name (it defaults to "Bot").
