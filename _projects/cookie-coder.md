# What's Cookie Coder?

Cookie Coder is a simple text-based game inspired by the popular (and mindless)
clicking game, Cookie Clicker. It was developed for the 2015 Pilot DC hackathon.

# Where can I play?

I often hear something along the lines of:

> Wow! That's so cool Naitian! Where can I play this innovative and groundbreaking
> game that pushes the very limits of human imagination?

Actually, I don't get that a lot, but in any case, you can check it out
